# 100 Days of Python Challenge

This repository tracks my progress through the **100 Days of Python Challenge**.  
The challenge is about building consistency, learning new concepts daily, and gradually moving from fundamentals to more complex projects.

## Progress
- **Days 1–21**: Focused on the **basics of Python** (variables, strings, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.).  
  I decided **not to share these on GitHub** since they were mainly practice exercises.  
- **Day 22 onward**: Contains more interesting and larger projects — these are included here in the repository.  

## Goals
- Build coding consistency.  
- Explore both beginner and advanced Python concepts.  
- Work on practical projects and share progress.
